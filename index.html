					Hey, Welcome to my site! I'm Steven Dao, the author of this site/blog. I am expected to graduate with
					the Bachelorâ€™s of Art & Science, in the Computer Science Specialist program from the University for Toronto.
					This site feels a little bare at the moment, but I am working hard to get this site up and running;
					while balancing school, work, and life!
				</p>

				<p>
					Posts under Projects will consist of mainly Do-It-Yourself projects and fixes, personal thoughts and reviews
					of
					things that tickle my fancy. Mainly computers, programming, mechanical keyboards, audio equipment and music
					(to name a few).
