For over two years now I have been using the Fredrik from IKEA, and it’s a great desk. It's clean, simple, and very spacey. In addition to this, I also use a DIY monitor stand that consists of an IKEA Ekby Jarpen shelf and some IKEA couch legs (shameless IKEA advertising). The Idea was taken was from <a href="http://www.ikeahackers.net/2013/09/triple-monitor-stand.html">here</a> and overall, it was wonderful solution for a home workstation.

Recently, I have been getting annoyed with all the loose wires hanging behind my desk and I thought to myself “There must be a better way”. So I decide to hit up the inter-webs for a clean solution, and I found that plain old binder clips can be used to clip wires to the side of your desks! Additionally, combining the binder clips with Velcro wire ties improved organization, and it blew my mind that such simple solution would be so effective. These initial pictures are very poor (I’m sorry), and they do not do any justice.

Coincidentally I have another Fredrik that is currently not being used, and as a result I decided to combine the two Fredriks into a corner desk. Another great idea, except all the wires I organized now have to be undone and redone.

Unfortunately, the monitor stand I made cannot achieve the correct angle I wanted. As a result, the monitor stand needed a slight modification where the hind legs were required to be moved inward toward the middle. To the best of my ability, I estimated 45 degrees from the front legs to the hind legs and re-drilled the leg holes.

The readjusted legs provided more support in the center of the stand and enabled me to find the perfect position (will be shown in the final result). I then proceeded to organize all the wires and began planning the wire routing. The Fredrik conveniently has a dedicated compartment where I placed the power bar, and all the power bricks for my components. I routed each of the wires to their corresponding component and Velcro tied the excess bits. Then proceeded to binder clip them to the desk. The main wire ‘clump’ is depicted in the photos below, but are covered when the monitor stand is in place.

From a close up shot, it still looks like a mess, but when you look at the desk as a whole it is hidden way.

The Final Result: Great Success!~ 

PS. Just wanted to point out that the positions for my AudioEngine A2s were measured to be symmetrical relative to where I sit, for my listening pleasure!
